Problems/Bugs:

- AE_To and AE_From and data are not properly adjusted to energy shift upon loading file
- When Exporting Data, have the selection for measurement data (and maybe also the range) in the file_save dialog
- Neon comparison for calibration measurements
- save disabled fit state
- closing file will not reset ddMain
- annotation doesnt get applied after loading file
- checkbox for constant poly continuation
- export all data and meta data not working, implement get_meta_string for polynomial and custom as well
- weighted polynomial fit behaving unexpectedly. Fit is more precise when unweighted. noticeable at seemingly random remainder data (difference after 2 or 3 fits)
- shift is behaving weird and wrong
