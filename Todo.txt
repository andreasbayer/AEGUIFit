- When Exporting Data, have the selection for measurement data (and maybe also the range) in the file_save dialog
- Neon comparison for calibration masurements
- adding two fits, then fitting the first does not update diffdata for second fit (with aefits)
- save disabled fit state
- closing file will not reset ddMain
